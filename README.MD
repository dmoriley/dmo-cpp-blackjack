#### What is this
This is a program my group and I wrote as part of a final program for college back in 2016. It is a Blackjack terminal game written in c++11.

#### How to compile with gcc
Run the command `g++ -std=c++11 BlackJack.cpp -o output_name`
- Must target c++11 or later to compile
- The flag `-o` is to indicate the name of the output file
- open the output file in the terminal to play the game
